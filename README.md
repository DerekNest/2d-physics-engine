# 2D Physics Engine from Scratch

A simple 2D physics engine built with JavaScript and HTML Canvas. This project simulates gravity, restitution (bounciness), and realistic collision resolution between multiple objects.

## Features
-   **Gravity:** Objects accelerate downwards.
-   **Boundary Collisions:** Objects bounce off the container walls.
-   **Object-Object Collisions:** Circles realistically collide and bounce off each other.
-   **Mass-Based Resolution:** Heavier (larger) circles have a greater impact in collisions.

## Built With
-   HTML5 Canvas
-   CSS
-   Vanilla JavaScript
